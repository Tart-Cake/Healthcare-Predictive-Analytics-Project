# Healthcare-Predictive-Analytics-Project
*"Predicting patient outcomes using machine learning and healthcare data."*

## Overview
The Healthcare Predictive Analytics project focuses on developing a predictive model to improve healthcare
outcomes by providing data-driven insights. The model will be designed to help healthcare professionals
with tasks such as patient risk prediction, trend identification in health metrics, and making informed
decisions based on predictive analytics. The project will utilize machine learning models to forecast
healthcare-related outcomes, focusing on improving patient care and resource management.
